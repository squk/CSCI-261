# CSCI 261 - Programming Concepts

This lab is due by September 07, 2016 08:00am.

### Pair Programming

* * *

  

For this lab, you will be working with a partner to practice pair programming and proper programming design.

Last week, you thought of equations relevant to your major that can be solved using a computer program. Below are a list of three equations provided from different sections. You and your partner will implement two of these three equations.

  
| Major |	Equation |	Formula |	Variables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chemistry | Ideal Gas Law | ![Ideal Gas Law][1] | V - volume <br>P - pressure  <br>n - # of moles  <br>R - gas constant  <br>T - temperature |
| Engineering Physics |  Newton's Law of Universal Gravitational |  ![Newton's Law of Universal Gravitational][2] |  FG \- Force of gravity  <br>G - gravitational constant  <br>m1 \- mass of body 1  <br>m2 \- mass of body 2  <br>(x1, y1) - location of body 1  <br>(x2, y2) - location of body 2 |
| Mechanical Engineering |  Escape Velocity |  ![Escape Velocity][3] |  vesc \- escape velocity  <br>G - gravitational constant <br>mE \- mass of Earth  <br>rE \- radius of Earth |

For each equation, you must:

* Define the appropriate variables that are needed giving them the proper data type, a proper identifier, and a sensible initial value
* Declare constants as needed
* You must prompt the user to enter all non-constant values for the equations
* Calculate the right hand side of the equation solving for the left hand side
* Print out the final computed value of the equation
* And as always, be sure to be providing helpful output to the user so the user provides the correct values and knows what is being returned
  
Now before you get started doing any coding, take out a piece of paper and write out the pseudocode to solve this task. Put your names (first &amp; last) at the top as you will be turning in your pseudocode as part of your grade. Once you have your pseudocode, determine who is going to drive first and get to coding! We will switch drivers every 5 minutes so listen for the cue to switch positions.

### Lab Submission

* * *

  

To receive full credit for this lab, you must do the following:

* Turn in a hardcopy of your pseudocode to the instructor at the end of class on Wed. Aug. 31
* **Both** members of your pair must turn in the same `main.cpp`
* **Both** of your names should be in the comments in the header of your file
You will submit your solution to this lab with the rest of Week02. Detailed instructions for doing this are posted in [Assignment 02][4].
